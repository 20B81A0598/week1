    Although our business has evolved over the years, one constant is customers’ desire for lower prices, better selection, and convenient services. Today, Amazon shoppers can find what they’re looking for online and in person. From delivering fresh produce to their doorstep to creating and distributing movies, music, and more, we are always finding new ways to delight our customers.
    Our passion for delighting customers drives us to constantly invent on their behalf. Working backward from customer needs, we’re constantly seeking to improve our services, add benefits and features, and invent new products. With this in mind, over the years we’ve launched innovative services such as Prime, Alexa and our family of Echo devices, award-winning entertainment, and exclusive Amazon products.
